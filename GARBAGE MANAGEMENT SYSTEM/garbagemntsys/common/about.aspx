    	&nbsp;<h4>Garbage Management System</h4>

        <p>Garbage is an unwanted waste material. It is the stuff we don’t need any more. Everyday we make tons of solid waste. It makes our environment unhealthy .Any waste material like cans, bottles, paper, kitchen waste and plastic bags are called garbage. There are things which can be reused, but we throw them away. 
First of all, as kids we can tell our parents, neighbors and classmates about reducing the amount of garbage they throw away. We can collect all the things which can be recycled, like cans, paper, plastic bags and bottles. Before we throw the things away, first look for what we can reuse and then look for what we can recycle and then leave the rest as garbage.
For waste reduction, avoid disposable things. We should not use too much paper towels and bathroom tissue. Use cloth towel instead. Cloth bags can be used for shopping. We can also refill water bottles, use both sides of paper and share magazines with others.
Landfills are also an answer for garbage disposal. We can sell reusable bags back to the shop because it is bad to use so much plastic. We should cut down the garbage we make by not throwing unnecessary things. We can hold a yard sale.
So we should always keep in mind that to keep our home and neighborhoods nice and clean and for healthy environment we need to remember and follow of these.

    	    Waste Management And Recycling</h4>
        <p>
Humans have always had an impact on their surroundings. Garbage is one of our biggest effects on nature. Unlike other animals, humans create too much waste for nature to keep up. American’s create almost 210 million tons of waste a year. Almost 42 percent of that garbage is in paper wastes. With the continually rising of the earth’s population, the situation is going to get harder and harder to slow, or fix.
With garbage comes pollution. In our burning of garbage we are destroying the atmosphere just as fast as we are just leaving the garbage on the ground. When you burn garbage it gives off extremely poisonous gases into the atmosphere. If a person breathes this air it can hurt their lungs and if untreated can result in death. Even if we bury our garbage it will not go away. By polluting the ground it can seep into our farming soil and even into our ground water.
The biggest solution to our garbage problem is the fabled R.R.R. (reduce, reuse, recycle as you have certainly heard before). If 42 percent of our garbage is paper wastes, that is 42 percent preventable garbage. Imaging if everyone recycled their paper instead of throwing it out. Our landfills would increase at considerably lower rates and we would prevent the releasing of harmful gases into the atmosphere from them. In Denmark large efforts are being used to reduce garbage. Their goal is to have over 60 percent of household goods to be recycled. If every nation followed this same ambition to reduce our garbage problem, our future will be much brighter for our children

            Recycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate In the United States, over 245 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) was produced by consumers in 2005. This is approximately 4.5 pounds of trash per person per day.[3] This same year, 79 million tons of waste were recycled, a dramatic increase from 15 million tons in 1980.[3] Of the total MSW in 2003,11.1% (26.7 million tons) was plastic. Although only 3.9% of plastics disposed in 2003 were recycled, PET was recovered at a rate of 25%.[4] There are six classifications of plastics, each assigned a number....    
Solitude of the Garage I walked outside into the cool April morning. The air around me was a slightly stinging cold; nevertheless, I took a big deep breath of the refreshing mountain air. I walked over to my dads red and white 1979 Ford F150 pickup and started it for him. I brought it around to the front of the house, put the transmission in neutral, and set the parking brake. After hopping out of the cab, I met my dad coming out of the house, and went around the front of the truck. I hopped into the passenger seat while my dad got into the drivers seat.... 
Recycling During the early 1970s, as communities across the United States saw their landfills filling up, attention turned to alternative methods of garbage disposal, such as incineration and recycling. While incineration proved to be a thorny issue due to its toxic ash byproduct, recycling was embraced by Americans as an effective way to offset rising garbage production rates. Today, demand for recycled products is beginning to match supply, and the percentage of waste going into landfills and incinerators is decreasing steadily</p>
