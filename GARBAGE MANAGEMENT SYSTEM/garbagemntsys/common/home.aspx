            of the Garbage Management System and Recycling</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="cleaner h10"></div>
        <p>The new system allows for one vehicle to pick up both household waste and recyclables at the same time in a split bodied vehicle. An automated arm lifts and empties the waste bin into the vehicle’s waste compartment.

The arm then lifts and empties the recycling bin into the recycling compartment.
At the landfill, the vehicle’s waste compartment is emptied first. Because sorting of recyclables is not necessary with the new system, recycling is much easier. This means less waste in the landfill.

The vehicle then empties the recycling compartment into collection units that will be transported to a municipal recycling facility for sorting.</p>

        <div class="cleaner h10"></div>
        <p>Garbage management or Waste disposal is all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.[1] This includes amongst other things, collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. It also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling etc.<br />The life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle. Each of the above stages of the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.[5][page needed] The key behind the life-cycle of a product is to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.</p>
